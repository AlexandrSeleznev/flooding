1.27.1 (2012-10-22)
-------------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.23.1 for a tiny change to the breach info
page (so that links to scenarios actually work...)


1.27 (2012-10-19)
-----------------

Increase flooding-base to 1.32:
Add Javascript that can open a specific project/scenario upon loading
the homepage.

Get the information about which scenario to open from the session (it
is set in a view in flooding-lib).

Increase flooding-lib to 2.23:
Adapt comment line removing functions so that they can also be called
on individual files, and don't depend on the size of /tmp on the
webserver anymore.

Change the zipfile creation functions so that they don't try to do
everything in memory.

Add a link (/flooding/preload/<project_id>/</scenario_id>/) that puts
relevant information in the session and then redirects to the front
page. Code in flooding-base 1.32 then causes the right scenario to
open.


1.26 (2012-10-17)
-----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.22:
Replaced the parameter 'scenario_id' with 'body' in perform_task function of
'tasks.perform_task' module.

Increase lizard-worker to 0.3:
Replaced the parameter 'scenario_id' with 'body' in callback function of
'action_task' module.


1.25 (2012-10-17)
-----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.21:
Adds a view that returns a zipfile containing all the result files of a
given scenario, possibly first unzipped. The view checks whether the
user has approval permissions in at least one of the projects the
scenario belongs to.

Adds the view to the breach info page as a 'download' link for each
scenario listed.

Adds a 'check_scenario_permission' method to the permission manager.



1.24 (2012-10-16)
-----------------

- Configured flooding_lib.perform_task module.

- Removed sentry handler.

- Pinned lizard-worker 0.2.

- Removed flooding-worker.

- Increase flooding-lib to 2.20
Added tasks and perform_task.py.
Changed references flooding_worker to lizard_worker.


1.23 (2012-10-15)
-----------------

- Increase flooding-worker to 1.6
Modify calculate_scenario_statistics so that it also under Windows
(there were problems with deleting directories while the files in them
were still open).


1.22 (2012-10-15)
-----------------

- Increase flooding-worker to 1.5
Added task TASK_CALCULATE_STATISTICS.
Fixed error on model's combination in openbreach.py.


1.21 (2012-10-15)
-----------------

- Increased flooding-lib to 2.19. Changes:
Added an OpenStreetMap background for the max water depth
images. Synchronized panning and zooming, and checkboxes to turn them
on and off (in case there are many on one page and the user wants to
compare two).

Fix a bug with Excel metadata downloads. This was caused by new mixins
for all class based views, that set all kwargs on the view and always
add a permission manager. This meant that the kwargs weren't sent as
arguments anymore, resulting in an exception. It also meant that the
@receives_permission_manager decorators on class based views can be
removed.

- Configured task CALCULATE_SCENARIO_STATISTICS.


1.20 (2012-10-10)
-----------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.18. Changes:

The remove comments script would unzip files that don't fit on the
filesystem. Now it has a fixed limit of 1G for the unzipped files.

Added a management command that can restore the old approval comments
that were lost when we moved to all-approvaltool approvals.

Decreased width of the headers of max water depth images on the breach
info screen; it's nice that the images themselves aren't large, but if
their title is too wide you still can't see them side to side.


1.19 (2012-10-09)
-----------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.17.2. Changes:
Fix to a bug with deleting comment lines at import time.

A "Breach info" page for ROR/Landelijk Gebruik approvers that shows
some summary info per scenario at a breach location.

Increased flooding-lib to 2.16.
Changes:
If there are ROR scenarios under a breach, and user is allowed to see
them, show an (I) icon next to the breach

Add a view and a template for the page that shows them.

Add several class based view mixins, we're going to use those
consistently from now on.

Start pages.py for standalone pages.

Add methods to Scenario for getting results and presentation layers.

Add new resulttypes for total inundation volume and inundated area.

Make numbers in the new breach info page human readable.

Increased flooding-worker to 1.4:
Added task that can calculate scenario statistics (namely, total
inundation area and inundated volume). Also made it into a management
command for ease of use.

Increased flooding-base to 1.31:
Changed Javascript, now showing an (I) icon link after some breaches
(only works with new services.py from flooding-lib).


Increased flooding-lib to 2.15.
Changes:
Added functions to walk a directory tree structure and scan all its
files, even files included in .zip files.

Added functions that check if any of those have is an .asc or .inc
with a comment line (starting with /*), and remove it.

Also add a management command for that.

Also add that functionality to uploaded files in the importtool.

Increased floding-worker to 1.3

Changes:
Close db connection in png_genaration.py before saving images.
Exclude an empty value of color_mapping_name field bij in png_generation.py.
Added authentication check.


1.18 (2012-09-07)
-----------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.14

Changes:
Add functionality for auto-start of seanrio's calculation
on create and import a new scenario.

Increased flooding-worker to 1.2

Changes:
Close connection before spawning subprocess and on the end
of the task.

1.17 (2012-09-05)
-----------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.13.1.

Changes in 2.13:
Add two boolean fields 'has_sobek_presentation' and
'has_hisssm_presentation' to Scenario that will be set to True by
flooding-worker tasks 155 and 185 when they are successful.

Changes in 2.13.1:
Fix a bug in groupimport; a primary key (id=1) was hardcoded for an
approval object type, even though that primary key doesn't exist
anymore in production. It now correctly uses the
default_approval_type() class method.

1.16 (2012-09-03)
-----------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.12:
- Add two boolean fields 'has_sobek_presentation' and
 'has_hisssm_presentation' to Scenario that will be set to True by
 flooding-worker tasks 155 and 185 when they are successful.

Increased flooding_worker to 1.1:
- Add functionality to update the Scenario's status in task 155 and 185.

1.15 (2012-08-31)
-----------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.12 two fix two bugs:
- Sometimes a scenario was seen as missing some required metadata, but
  if that metadata is outside of the control of the scenario owner
  that should be ignored
- Sometimes the data owner information (which is used to decide which
  province a scenario is in) is stored as an int, sometimes as a
  string. The province-deciding function can now use both.

- Increased flooding-lib to 2.11.2 because the workflow_template field
  wasn't set yet.

- Added a template to view the flooding scenarios, workflows, loggings.

- Added functionality to run scenario from GUI.

- Updated flooding-worker to 1.0

- Sort scenarios by id in the template scenarios_processing.html.

- Updated nens package to 1.11.

1.14.1 (2012-08-29)
-------------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.11.1 for a small fix (create excel files
management command didn't work).


1.14 (2012-08-29)
-----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.11. Changes since the previous version:

If a user uploading an Excel file for a project has approval rights in
that project, the approval information in that file as read as well.

Error messages on the ROR dashboard has improved, in the sense that they
are actually shown now. There is also a success message.

Invalid approval values (values other than 0 or 1) now result in an
error message instead of being silently ignored.

Increase flooding-lib to 2.10. Changes since the previous version:

- Added functionality to add a workflow_template to new scenario.

- Added migration to create default workflow_templates.

- Add a 'Goedkeuring' sheet to the Excel metadata export. It shows
  scenarioid, scenario identification and scenario name, and the
  approval status for each of the applicable approval rules, plus
  remarks in an extra column. Code for generation and importing is now
  done and unit testing, but not tested "for real" yet because we will
  first make the necessary user interface in a branch.

- Added a 'flooding_lib.sharedproject' sub-app that will hold pages
  and models to do with the ROR and Landelijk gebruik projects.
  A 'ROR dashboard' is now available under /flooding/shared/ror/,
  down- and uploading Excel files per province works.

- Make it mandatory to first collect all the necessary metadata before
  a scenario can be shared.

- Automatically set the value for the 'Metadata complete' approval
  rule when a scenario is accepted into one of the national projects.



1.13 (2012-08-24)
-----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.9. Changes since the previous version:

There were problems related to having a scenario in multiple projects,
approval, and visibility on the site.

- To normal users, only approved scenarios should be visible. This needs
  to check approval status in the right project (the project that gives
  the user viewing rights).

- For users with approval rights, an unapproved scenario is also visible,
  however the approval rights and unapproved status should relate to the
  same project.

- In the user interface, it may have been established that a user can
  see a given scenario, but it is still possible that it should be
  shown to the user only in some projects, not in all the projects the
  scenario may be in.

These issues were fixed.

In general, checking for the scenario statuses 'STATUS_APPROVED' and
'STATUS_DISAPPROVED' is dubious because they related only to the main
project and should maybe be removed in the future.

The scenarioproject table now has a cacheing 'approved' nullboolean that
is faster to use than the equivalent functions on ApprovalObject that need
to hit the database. There is a schema migration and a data migration to
create this field.


1.12 (2012-08-23)
-----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.8. Changes since the previous version:

Fix showing scenarios under projects in the user interface. A scenario
can occur in multiple projects, which means that it should be shown
under both projects in the user interface. Also, if a scenario that is
visible for a user because it is in a project that the user has rights
to is also in another project that the user doesn't have right to, the
second project shouldn't be shown at all. Both fixed.

Change the way that select fields in ExtraScenarioInfo rows are saved
(now as a string containing their value). Fix places where they are
displayed, add tests.



1.11 (2012-08-17)
-----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.10.1 (2012-08-17)
-------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.10 (2012-08-17)
-----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.9.1 (2012-08-16)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.9 (2012-08-16)
----------------

Fixes to Excel export/import, update to flooding-lib 2.6.1. Time to
release.


1.8 (2012-08-15)
----------------

Increase to 2.5.2. Improvements to the Excel import/export. Also fixes
a bug where a scenario's status didn't update after checking its
approval rules.


1.7 (2012-08-14)
----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.4.2 for another bug fix (approving
scenarios for import doesn't work).


1.6.1 (2012-08-14)
------------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.4.1, hopefully the import actually works
now...


1.6 (2012-08-14)
----------------

- Increased flooding-lib to 2.4. The import new scenario page wasn't
  working, this includes a quick fix.


1.5 (2012-08-10)
----------------

- Increased flooding-lib to 2.3.


1.4.1 (2012-07-23)
------------------

Trunk: updated to flooding-lib 2.0.1, which is a hotfix branch.

Approval objects will be completely changed. Because of this, all the
old ones need to be cleared from the database. First run all the
migrations of flooding_lib, then the migrations of approvaltool.

Updated flooding-base to 1.27 (cleanup).

After release, an ApprovalType for ROR should be set up, and the ROR
project should be changed so that it uses that type by default (right
now that's a manual database action).

1.4 (2012-07-09)
----------------

New versions of the Group import example files. Moved them into the
flooding site because they are updated now and then, makes it easier
to do releases.

Therefore, updated to flooding-base 1.26 which doesn't have the
example files anymore.

1.3 (2012-07-09)
----------------
- Tasks to do after update:
    bin/django loaddata flooding/fixtures/flooding_base_setting.json
    bin/django dbshell
        drop table lizard_flooding_worker_tasktype CASCADE;
        drop table lizard_flooding_worker_workflow CASCADE;
        drop table lizard_flooding_worker_workflowtask CASCADE;
        drop table lizard_flooding_worker_logging CASCADE;
        drop table lizard_flooding_worker_workflowtemplate CASCADE;
        drop table lizard_flooding_worker_workflowtemplatetask CASCADE;
    bin/django shell
        from south.models import *
        MigrationHistory.objects.filter(app_name='flooding_worker').delete()
    bin/django migrate flooding_worker
    bin/django loaddata flooding_worker

    bin/django migrate flooding_lib, but both 0001 and 0009 must be faked!

- Updated flooding-worker to 0.6.2:
    - Replaced dependency floding_worker.Workflow to flooding_lib.Scenario.
    - Created a new initial migrationschema.
    - Removed brokerconfig.py

- Updated flooding-lib to 2.0:
    1.35:
    - Add breadcrumbs to add files screen in import (#3687)
    - Make WAITING the default state for new ImportScenarios (#3685)
    - Large scale code formatting (pep8/pyflakes), down to 0 errors
      from ~2300
    - Refactor and test import code some more (move functionality from
      views into models)
    - Fixed import of PIL.Image.
    1.36:
    - Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier
    - Added ScenarioProject model
    - Did many changes to many files to make it possible to have
      a scenario be part of many projects (through ScenarioProject),
      instead of with the old foreign key
    - Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier
    - Added 'color_mapping_name' field to 'Project' model (the field
      exists yet, fake it on migration).
    1.37:
    - Fix issues relating to #3705; obviously import wasn't tested yet and
      there were several typos and things that couldn't work. Works on my
      development machine now.
    1.38:
    - Solves issues from Trac #3682. In the scenario info window:
    - Coordinates are shown in RD, not WGS84
    - Intervals are shown as '2 d 12:00', not as 2.5
    - Values like '-999' are treated as null values
    1.39:
    We are testing and fixed the following issues:
    - Restored a scenario.project_id field for the benefit of the old uitvoerder.py scripts
    - Forgot to set field.value_str instead of field.value for the
      scenario ID that we hack into the info window by hand
    - 999 was also sometimes used as a sentinel, just like -999. Ignore it too.
    - Changed another .project to .main_project
    - We should really use Unicode everywhere, people use non-ASCII
      characters and there's no reason why we should crash on them
    - Added an 'ignore' directory to .gitignore, helpful to put silly
      temporary files in
    - Updated flooding.settings due import error of PIL.Image
    - Added 'YEAR' setting to flooding_base.Setting for hisssm_160 task
      (as new record)
    2.0:
    - Fix tickets #3684 and #3711
    - Version bump just because

1.2 (2012-06-15)
----------------

- Changed to flooding-base, flooding-lib and flooding-worker, on Git.
