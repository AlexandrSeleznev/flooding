Changelog of flooding
===================================================


1.9 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.8 (2012-08-15)
----------------

Increase to 2.5.2. Improvements to the Excel import/export. Also fixes
a bug where a scenario's status didn't update after checking its
approval rules.


1.7 (2012-08-14)
----------------

Increase flooding-lib to 2.4.2 for another bug fix (approving
scenarios for import doesn't work).


1.6.1 (2012-08-14)
------------------

Increased flooding-lib to 2.4.1, hopefully the import actually works
now...


1.6 (2012-08-14)
----------------

- Increased flooding-lib to 2.4. The import new scenario page wasn't
  working, this includes a quick fix.


1.5 (2012-08-10)
----------------

- Increased flooding-lib to 2.3.


1.4.1 (2012-07-23)
------------------

Trunk: updated to flooding-lib 2.0.1, which is a hotfix branch.

Approval objects will be completely changed. Because of this, all the
old ones need to be cleared from the database. First run all the
migrations of flooding_lib, then the migrations of approvaltool.

Updated flooding-base to 1.27 (cleanup).

After release, an ApprovalType for ROR should be set up, and the ROR
project should be changed so that it uses that type by default (right
now that's a manual database action).

1.4 (2012-07-09)
----------------

New versions of the Group import example files. Moved them into the
flooding site because they are updated now and then, makes it easier
to do releases.

Therefore, updated to flooding-base 1.26 which doesn't have the
example files anymore.

1.3 (2012-07-09)
----------------

    bin/django migrate flooding_worker
    bin/django loaddata flooding_worker

    bin/django migrate flooding_lib, but both 0001 and 0009 must be faked!

- Updated flooding-worker to 0.6.2:
    - Replaced dependency floding_worker.Workflow to flooding_lib.Scenario.
    - Created a new initial migrationschema.
    - Removed brokerconfig.py

- Updated flooding-lib to 2.0:
    1.35:
    - Add breadcrumbs to add files screen in import (#3687)
    - Make WAITING the default state for new ImportScenarios (#3685)
    - Large scale code formatting (pep8/pyflakes), down to 0 errors
      from ~2300
    - Refactor and test import code some more (move functionality from
      views into models)
    - Fixed import of PIL.Image.
    1.36:
    - Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier
    - Added ScenarioProject model
    - Did many changes to many files to make it possible to have
      a scenario be part of many projects (through ScenarioProject),
      instead of with the old foreign key
    - Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier
    - Added 'color_mapping_name' field to 'Project' model (the field
      exists yet, fake it on migration).
    1.37:
    - Fix issues relating to #3705; obviously import wasn't tested yet and
      there were several typos and things that couldn't work. Works on my
      development machine now.
    1.38:
    - Solves issues from Trac #3682. In the scenario info window:
    - Coordinates are shown in RD, not WGS84
    - Intervals are shown as '2 d 12:00', not as 2.5
    - Values like '-999' are treated as null values
    1.39:
    We are testing and fixed the following issues:
    - Restored a scenario.project_id field for the benefit of the old uitvoerder.py scripts
    - Forgot to set field.value_str instead of field.value for the
      scenario ID that we hack into the info window by hand
    - 999 was also sometimes used as a sentinel, just like -999. Ignore it too.
    - Changed another .project to .main_project
    - We should really use Unicode everywhere, people use non-ASCII
      characters and there's no reason why we should crash on them
    - Added an 'ignore' directory to .gitignore, helpful to put silly
      temporary files in
    - Updated flooding.settings due import error of PIL.Image
    - Added 'YEAR' setting to flooding_base.Setting for hisssm_160 task
      (as new record)
    2.0:
    - Fix tickets #3684 and #3711
    - Version bump just because
